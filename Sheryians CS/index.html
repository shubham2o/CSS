    <h2>% v/s vw or vh</h2>
    <p>• % takes its value from its parent every-time.</p>
    <p>• On the other hand, vw or vh takes its value from the output screen.</p>

    <h2>em v/s rem</h2>
    <p>
      • They both are relative units, meaning their size is determined based on
      another value, typically the font size of an element.
    </p>
    <p>
      • em unit is relative to the font size of its parent element. For example,
      if the font size of a parent element is 16px, 1em is equivalent to 16px.
      If you set font-size: 2em; on a child element, it would be twice the size
      of its parent's font size.
    </p>
    <p>
      • rem unit is relative to the root element's font size, which is usually
      the &lt;html&gt; element. So, if the root element's font size is set to
      16px, 1rem is equivalent to 16px regardless of the font size of its parent
      elements.

    <h2>Block elements v/s inline elements v/s inline-block elements</h2>
    <p>
      • Block elements are elements that always start on a new line and take up
      the full width available to them. For example, if you use a &lt;div&gt; or
      &lt;p&gt; tag, it will create a new section that takes up the full width
      available.
    </p>
    <p>
      • Inline elements flow with the text, meaning they don't start on a new
      line. They only take up as much space as necessary. For example,
      &lt;span&gt; or &lt;a&gt; tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      • Inline-Block elements are a bit interesting. They take up horizontal
      space like block elements, but they don't start on a new line. It means
      they take up the width but don't force a line break. An example is the
      &lt;imp&gt; tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      • So, if you are converting an image from inline-block to block, it means
      you want that image to start on a new line and take up the full width.

    <h2>Flexbox</h2>
    <p>
      • It allows you to align elements horizontally and vertically, distribute
      space between them, make them responsive. You set up a flex container,
      which is like a box to hold your elements, and then you place flex items
      inside it.
    </p>
    <p>• X axis = Horizontal (-) = MAIN = justify-content</p>
    <p>• Y axis = Vertical (|) = CROSS = align-items</p>
    <br />
    <div id="container2">
      <div id="one"></div>

    <h2>pseudo-elements (::)</h2>
    <div id="pseudo-el">
      <p>
        Pseudo-elements in CSS are imaginary elements that allow you to style
        specific parts of an element, like the first letter, first-line, or
        last-child
      </p>
      <p>They are indicated by " :: " in CSS</p>
      <p>
        They are handy when you want to achieve specific design effects that
        can't be done with regular elements alone
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <hr size="5" noshade />

    <h2>pseudo-classes (:)</h2>
    <div id="pseudo-cl">
      <p>
        • Pseudo-classes in CSS are like special tags that help you style
        elements on their current state or interaction.
      </p>
      <p>• They are indicated by " : " in CSS.</p>
      <p>
        • For example, you might want to change the color of a button when
        someone hovers over it, or you want to change the color of a link when
        someone click on it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Grid</h2>
    <p>
      • Grid in CSS is a way to create a structure for laying out web content.
      It allows you to divide a webpage into rows and columns, similar to how a
      table works.
    </p>
    <p>
      • This gives you flexibility to arrange different elements of your
      webpage, like text and images, in an organized manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      • It makes your webpage responsive, meaning it will look good on different
      screen sizes. Using a grid helps you have more control over the design of
      your webpage and makes it easier to keep everything neat and tidy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <hr size="5" noshade />

    <h2>Grid v/s Flexbox</h2>
    <p>
      • Grid allows you to create a grid-like structure with rows and columns,
      giving you precise control over the layout of your elements. It is
      multi-dimensional which means it can work on both X-axis (rows) and Y-axis
      (columns).
    </p>
    <p>
      • Flexbox, on the other hand, lets you arrange elements in a single line,
      like lining up books on a shelf. It's more flexible when you need to
      arrange items in a single row or column. It is single dimensional which
      means it can work only on one, either on X-axis (rows) or on Y-axis
      (columns).
    </p>
    <p>
      • So, if you need a precise grid layout with rows and columns, Grid might
      be a better choice. But if you need to arrange items in a single line,
      Flexbox is more suitable. Sometimes, you can even use both depending on
      your design needs.
