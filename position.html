         <h1>position: relative;</h1>
         <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>
         <div class="one">This div element has position: relative;</div>

         <br><hr size="5" noshade><br>

         <h1>position: fixed;</h1>
         <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
             which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:
         <div class="two">This div element has position: fixed;</div>
         </p>

         <br><hr size="5" noshade><br>

         <h1>position: static;</h1>
         <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is 
             always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
         </p>
         <div class="three">This div element has position: static;</div>

         <br><hr size="5" noshade><br>

         <h1>position: absolute;</h1>
         <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest 
             positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):
         </p>
             <div class="four">This div element has position: relative;
                 <div class="five">
                     This div element has position: absolute;
                 </div>
             </div>
     </body>
